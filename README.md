🧠🔐 CyberLearner
CyberLearner is a web-based cryptography learning tool that allows users to experiment with various classical and modern encryption algorithms. It supports both encryption and decryption operations, provides algorithm descriptions, and features a dark/light theme switch, user history log, and a built-in user guide.

🔧 Features
Encrypt or decrypt messages using a wide range of algorithms:

AES, DES, RC4, Caesar, Vigenère, Atbash, ROT13, Playfair

Rail Fence, Columnar Transposition, One-Time Pad

Base64, Hexadecimal Encoding, Morse Code

MD5, SHA-256 (one-way hashing)

Key validation and customized key input guidance

Algorithm descriptions and "How it Works" explanations

History log of previous encryption/decryption actions

Light/Dark theme toggle

User-friendly interface with responsive design

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the application locally, you'll need:

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
